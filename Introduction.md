# GIT AND GITHUB
Git is a *distributed version control system*. Let's break down what that means.

**Distributed** refers to how each collaborator has their own repository - their own copy of the entire project - which is stored locally. There is no single 'sandbox' that holds the project and its history within it, as every developer has their own local sandbox where they can make changes offline.

Note that this is in constrast with **centralized** version control systems, where everyone's changes are maintained on a central server that each collaborator pulls from and pushes to.

Git is a system that is used to keep track of the history of your project, as well as enable others to collaborate on the project together. Think of it as *social coding*!

If Git is the language of social coding, then GitHub is our 'Facebook' - the social network. GitHub is the place to store your projects and share them with the world.

# HISTORY
Git was created by the inventor of Linux, Linus Torvalds in 2005. Linux developers were already using a distributed version control system called BitKeeper, which actually inspired Git, and another distributed version control tool called Mercurial.
