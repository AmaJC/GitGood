# GIT AND GITHUB
Git is a distributed version control system. Let's break down what that means.
'Distributed' refers to how each collaborator has their own repository - their own copy of the entire project - which is stored locally. There is no single 'sandbox' that holds the project and its history within it, as every developer has their own local sandbox 

Git is a system that is used to keep track of the history of your project, as well as enable others to collaborate on the project together.
